        "markdown": "\nIn This tutorial we will create Flat And Responsive Registration Form With Html5 Validation and is for the ones who want a simple responsive registration or contact form for their website or any web application.\n\nTo create a working registration form you need a basic knowledge of the HTML5 and CSS3 which you may probably have.\n\n**Thing You’ll need :** A Code Editor (eg: Sublime Text)\n\n**Difficulty level :**  Beginner\n\n**Time :** 15 minutes\n\nOur Page will contain a Sign Up and Registration Form Including a form for forgotten Password. The method is pretty simple and can be setup within minutes we have used basic html5 validation to confirm the input in the form if you want to use it for commercial purposes you might want to take a better approach for validation.\n\n**Here It Goes** : Create a Html page and name it index.html\n\n```\n     <!doctype html> \n      <html lang=\"en\">\n      \n          <meta charset=\"UTF-8\"> \n          <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html\" charset=\"UTF-8\" > \n          <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge,chrome=1\" > \n          <meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"True\" > \n          <meta name=\"MobileOptimized\" content=\"320\" > \n          <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" > \n          <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"assets/css/style.css\"> \n          <title>Flat And Responsive Contact Form With Html5 Validation | CodexTuts </title> \n      \n```\n\nPaste this in the file, this is the head section you might probably be aware of this. Next Step is to write the HTML for the username and password field.  \n**Username/Password**\n\n```\n   <fieldset> \n    <span><legend>Login To Your Account</legend></span> \n    <form method=\"POST\" action=\"index.html\"> \n        <p><input name=\"username\" class=\"required\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Username\" required></p> \n        <p> <input name=\"password\" type=\"password\" placeholder=\"Password\" required></p> \n        <p class=\"remember\"><label for=\"checkbox\">\n            <input name=\"remember-me\" type=\"checkbox\"value=\"forever\"> Remember Me\n        </label></p> \n        <p><input type=\"submit\" value=\"Login\" class=\"button-link-submit\"></input></p> \n        <p><a href=\"#reset-pass\">I’ve forgotten my password</a></p> \n     </form> \n   </fieldset>\n```\n\nNext is the Sign Up form This page includes pretty basic info like the First Name, Last Name, Country, Address etc. Here’s the mark Up\n\n```\n     <--**Start Copying From here** -->\n    <fieldset> \n        <form action=\"index.html\"> \n            <span><legend>Create an account</legend></span> \n            <p><input type=\"text\" name=\"email\" class=\"\" type=\"email\" placeholder=\"Email\" title=\"Email\" required> </p>\n            <p> <input class=\"\" type=\"text\" name=\"first-name\" placeholder=\"First Name\" value=\"\" required> </p> \n            <p> <input class=\"\" type=\"text\" name=\"last-name\" placeholder=\"Last name\" value=\"\" required> </p> \n            <p> <input name=\"username\" class=\"required\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Username\" required> </p> \n            <p> <input type=\"text\" name=\"password\" id=\"password\" class=\"\" placeholder=\"Password\" type=\"password\" required> </p> \n            <p> <input type=\"text\" name=\"confirm-password\" id=\"\" class=\"\" placeholder=\"Confirm password\" type=\"password\" required> </p> \n            <p> <input type=\"text\" value=\"\" name=\"telnocc\" placeholder=\"Country Code\" maxlength=\"4\"> \n            <input type=\"text\" value=\"\" placeholder=\"Mobile no.\" name=\"telno\" maxlength=\"15\"> </p> \n            <p> <input type=\"text\" name=\"card_address\" class=\"\" placeholder=\"Address\" value=\"\" required> </p> \n            <p> <select name=\"country\" id=\"country\" class=\"select\"> <option value=\"IN\">India</option></select> </p> \n            <p> <span> <select id=\"stateSelect\" name=\"state\" class=\"select\"> <option value=\"Select State\">Select State</option></select> </span> </p> \n            <p> <input type=\"text\" size=\"10\" name=\"pincode\" class=\"\" placeholder=\"Postcode / ZIP\" value=\"\" required> </p> \n            <p> <label for=\"checkbox\"> <input name=\"tandc\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"forever\" required> By clicking the \"Buy Now\" button above you agree to the <a href=\"#\">Terms of Service.</a></label> \n            <p> <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Create An Account\" class=\"button-link-submit\"></input> </p> \n            </form> \n            </fieldset>\n```\n\n<small> *sorry about the mess in the code just copy and paste it, it’ll work </small>\n\nNext is the **Reset Password Area** this just has an input area for the email and a submit button.\n\n```\n    <fieldset id=\"reset-pass\"> \n      <span><legend>Reset your Password</legend></span> \n      <form method=\"POST\" action=\"index.html\"> \n        <p>Enter your registered email address</p> \n        <p><input name=\"username\" class=\"required\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Registered Email\" required> </p> \n        <p><input type=\"submit\" value=\"Give me a new password\" class=\"button-link-submit\"></input> </p> \n    </form> \n    </fieldset> \n```\n\nOnce you paste it all in, save it and try to view it in your browser. You should get a pretty basic form.

The method is pretty simple and can be setup within minutes we have used basic html5 validation to confirm the input in the form if you want to use it for commercial purposes you might want to take a better approach for validation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here It Goes</strong> : Create a Html page and name it index.html</p>\n\n<pre><code>     &lt;!doctype html&gt; \n      &lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n\n          &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\"&gt; \n          &lt;meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html\" charset=\"UTF-8\" &gt; \n          &lt;meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge,chrome=1\" &gt; \n          &lt;meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"True\" &gt; \n          &lt;meta name=\"MobileOptimized\" content=\"320\" &gt; \n          &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" &gt; \n          &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"assets/css/style.css\"&gt; \n          &lt;title&gt;Flat And Responsive Contact Form With Html5 Validation | CodexTuts &lt;/title&gt; \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Paste this in the file, this is the head section you might probably be aware of this. Next Step is to write the HTML for the username and password field. <br />\n<strong>Username/Password</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>   &lt;fieldset&gt; \n    &lt;span&gt;&lt;legend&gt;Login To Your Account&lt;/legend&gt;&lt;/span&gt; \n    &lt;form method=\"POST\" action=\"index.html\"&gt; \n        &lt;p&gt;&lt;input name=\"username\" class=\"required\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Username\" required&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \n        &lt;p&gt; &lt;input name=\"password\" type=\"password\" placeholder=\"Password\" required&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \n        &lt;p class=\"remember\"&gt;&lt;label for=\"checkbox\"&gt;\n            &lt;input name=\"remember-me\" type=\"checkbox\"value=\"forever\"&gt; Remember Me\n        &lt;/label&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \n        &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Login\" class=\"button-link-submit\"&gt;&lt;/input&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \n        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"#reset-pass\"&gt;I’ve forgotten my password&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \n     &lt;/form&gt; \n   &lt;/fieldset&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Next is the Sign Up form This page includes pretty basic info like the First Name, Last Name, Country, Address etc. Here’s the mark Up</p>\n\n<pre><code>     &lt;--**Start Copying From here** --&gt;\n    &lt;fieldset&gt; \n        &lt;form action=\"index.html\"&gt; \n            &lt;span&gt;&lt;legend&gt;Create an account&lt;/legend&gt;&lt;/span&gt; \n            &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"email\" class=\"\" type=\"email\" placeholder=\"Email\" title=\"Email\" required&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n            &lt;p&gt; &lt;input class=\"\" type=\"text\" name=\"first-name\" placeholder=\"First Name\" value=\"\" required&gt; &lt;/p&gt; \n            &lt;p&gt; &lt;input class=\"\" type=\"text\" name=\"last-name\" placeholder=\"Last name\" value=\"\" required&gt; &lt;/p&gt; \n            &lt;p&gt; &lt;input name=\"username\" class=\"required\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Username\" required&gt; &lt;/p&gt; \n            &lt;p&gt; &lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"password\" id=\"password\" class=\"\" placeholder=\"Password\" type=\"password\" required&gt; &lt;/p&gt; \n            &lt;p&gt; &lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"confirm-password\" id=\"\" class=\"\" placeholder=\"Confirm password\" type=\"password\" required&gt; &lt;/p&gt; \n            &lt;p&gt; &lt;input type=\"text\" value=\"\" name=\"telnocc\" placeholder=\"Country Code\" maxlength=\"4\"&gt; \n            &lt;input type=\"text\" value=\"\" placeholder=\"Mobile no.\" name=\"telno\" maxlength=\"15\"&gt; &lt;/p&gt; \n            &lt;p&gt; &lt;input type=\"text\" name=\"card_address\" class=\"\" placeholder=\"Address\" value=\"\" required&gt; &lt;/p&gt; \n            &lt;p&gt; &lt;select name=\"country\" id=\"country\" class=\"select\"&gt; &lt;option value=\"IN\"&gt;India&lt;/option&gt;&lt;/select&gt; &lt;/p&gt; \n            &lt;p&gt; &lt;span&gt; &lt;select id=\"stateSelect\" name=\"state\" class=\"select\"&gt; &lt;option value=\"Select State\"&gt;Select State&lt;/option&gt;&lt;/select&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; \n            &lt;p&gt; &lt;input type=\"text\" size=\"10\" name=\"pincode\" class=\"\" placeholder=\"Postcode / ZIP\" value=\"\" required&gt; &lt;/p&gt; \n            &lt;p&gt; &lt;label for=\"checkbox\"&gt; &lt;input name=\"tandc\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"forever\" required&gt; By clicking the \"Buy Now\" button above you agree to the &lt;a href=\"#\"&gt;Terms of Service.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/label&gt; \n            &lt;p&gt; &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Create An Account\" class=\"button-link-submit\"&gt;&lt;/input&gt; &lt;/p&gt; \n            &lt;/form&gt; \n            &lt;/fieldset&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><small> *sorry about the mess in the code just copy and paste it, it’ll work </small></p>\n\n<p>Next is the <strong>Reset Password Area</strong> this just has an input area for the email and a submit button.</p>\n\n<pre><code>    &lt;fieldset id=\"reset-pass\"&gt; \n      &lt;span&gt;&lt;legend&gt;Reset your Password&lt;/legend&gt;&lt;/span&gt; \n      &lt;form method=\"POST\" action=\"index.html\"&gt; \n        &lt;p&gt;Enter your registered email address&lt;/p&gt; \n        &lt;p&gt;&lt;input name=\"username\" class=\"required\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Registered Email\" required&gt; &lt;/p&gt; \n        &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Give me a new password\" class=\"button-link-submit\"&gt;&lt;/input&gt; &lt;/p&gt; \n    &lt;/form&gt; \n    &lt;/fieldset&gt; \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Once you paste it all in, save it and try to view it in your browser.

That’s why companies including eBay, BBC, Instagram, LinkedIn, Square, and Groupon all use Sass and Compass to produce their CSS.\n\nSASS isn’t read by the browser as a normal stylesheet file with eg: style.css. Instead the actual CSS file is complied from SASS file which has an extension of .scss and then used in the webpage as a normal CSS Stylesheet.\n\n**So you might ask, if we use CSS itself then why do we need SASS for ? Good Question !**\n\nCSS as you know is a declarative language that means whatever rules we write browser will use them as is to fill the screen, a programming language on the other hand is more expressive and flexible, use of mixins, variables, functions help in creating meaningful programs.\n\nSimilar is the case with SASS, it lets us use variables, mixins, conditions etc. in our CSS which helps in reducing the time taken to write those CSS rules.\n\nEg: We usually set color to anything in such a way right ?\n\n```\n    background-color:#ddd \n    or \n    color:#ddd;\n```\n\nNow imagine the same color is been used in various places other places including the background and for some weird reason you might have to change the grey color to red, you will have to end up finding all the occurrences of the color and change it manually.\n\nThis is where SASS variable comes in handy, here we can define the color at one single place and use it wherever we want to this,\n\n```\n    $grey-color:#ddd; \n```\n\nTo use it:\n\n```\n    background-color:$grey-color; \n    Or \n    color:$grey-color; \n```\n\nYou can use it as many times you want and if you have to change the color, you won’t have to do it everywhere, you just have to change the color code where you defined the variable.\n\nEnough talking lets get started, begin with installing SASS on your windows/mac/ubuntu Machines.\n\n**Installing SASS and Compass :**\n\nBoth need Ruby environment to be installed, as these are installed as a Ruby Gem, if you haven’t set up Ruby yet just head on to rubyinstaller.org and get setup with Ruby. Ruby gem comes bundled with fresh installation of Ruby.   \n<small>*Mac already comes with Ruby so move on to next step *</small>*  \n<small></small>*<small>if on windows add ruby to your environment path</small>\n\nFire up your terminal/command prompt and just do :\n\n```\n    gem install sass\n    gem install compass\n```\n\nIn some cases Mac/Linux users might have to do sudo gem install compass Once you hit enter the Gem installer will do its magic sit back in relax it won’t take much long.\n\nOnce the waterfall stops verify whether everything went well. Check the versions installed\n\n```\n    sass --version\n    or\n    compass --version\n```\n\nLets start a new application to use SASS, follow the commands below\n\n```\n    comapass create sass-test\n    cd sass-test\n    sass-test > ls or dir\n```\n\nHere you’ll see the generated files in a Compass project\n\n- **.sass-cache:** This folder will contain the cache files that Sass uses to build your CSS files faster. You don’t need to do anything with it.\n- **sass:** This folder will store the Sass files that will be written or amended.\n- **stylesheets:** This folder will contain the compiled CSS files that Sass will generate.\n- **config.rb:** This file contains the configuration defaults for a project, what the various folders are called, and where they are located. It also controls the compression style of the generated CSS.\n\nSASS and Compass have live reload capablility and we’ll have to tell SASS to watch for changes made to the files, this will help to complie and recomplie css automatically without having to reload, to do this.\n\n```\n    sass-test > sass --watch sass:css\n```\n\nWhat this does is, it tells SASS to watch the sass folder and complie to css folder. SASS also has a lot of built in commands to help you through.\n\n```\n    sass --help \n```\n\nthis will bring up all the commands you can use to play with SASS.\n\nHope this article helped we’ll be covering more on SASS in further articles makes sure you follow the blog.\n\nHappy Coding!\n\n\n",

        "markdown": "> Ghost is an awesome new blogging platform that focuses on content creation and presentation over the superfluous bells and whistles that dominate other platforms. It provides a clean, easy-to-use interface and can produce very polished results.\n\nSo you've decided to go solo on using Ghost blog rather than using the Ghost's hosting platform, this guide will help you install Ghost Blog on DigitalOcean and use custom themes and setup your own domain for your Ghost blog.\n\n\n### Installing Ghost on DigitalOcean Droplet\n\n* Get a latest copy of Ghost source code from http://ghost.org\n* Sign-up for DigitalOcean if you haven't already use [this](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=3bfc616a9162) link to get $10 credit\n* Setup your payment info and create a new droplet, a droplet is a virtual server in digitalocean's terms\n\t* Give a name to the droplet \n    * select Size of the droplet \n    * Select server location closest to your audience \n    * Under Selectimages use Ghost on Ubuntu 14.04\n    * Add your local system's ssh key to access the droplet via Terminal (optional)\n    * If all done properly hit create droplet, this will create an instance of Ghost on the droplet and within a couple minutes your blog will be ready to play with\n \n \nOnce this is done you can access your blog by using the IP address of the droplet it might look like this **123.456.789.01**. Open this address in your browser and you can see your blog live, to add a new user/author account goto  yourip/ghost and follow the instructions.\n\n### Setting Up domain Name\n\nSo your blog is live but you wouldn't want to access the blog over an IP, so in the next step we'll make your domain point to droplet server.\n\nTo do this login to your droplet from terminal using this command \n\n\t\tssh root@yourIP\n        \nIf you have setup  droplet using ssh key it will take you in directly. Or you can also use \"*console access*\" goto your control panel, select your droplet, and choose 'access', then press the 'Console Access' button. Once your console loads you'll need to log in. You should have received an email from DigitalOcean with the login details for your new droplet.\n\nWe are doing this to change the nginx configuration to match your domain name.\n\n**Step 1 :**\n\nType <code>nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/ghost </code> to open the nginx config file for editing in the nano editor. Change the current server_name from my-ghost-blog.com to your domain name.\n\n![Changing nginx config](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/ghost/nginx-config.png)\n\n<small>using nano: Use the arrow keys to move the cursor around instead of the mouse. Once done, press ctrl + x to exit. Nano will ask you if you want to save, type y for yes, and press enter to save the file.</small>\n\n**Step 2:**\n\nEdit the Ghost configuration file\n\nContinue in console, enter <code>nano /var/www/ghost/config.js</code> to open the Ghost configuration file for editing.\n\nThe Ghost config.js file contains configuration for different environments, your Droplet is automatically configured to run in production mode, Under production url : change it with your domain name.\n\n![Ghost config.js edit](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/ghost/ghost-config.png)\n\nAfter doing these two steps make sure you restart Ghost using this command\n\n\t\tservice ghost restart\n\nAnd thats about it in configuring your domain name.\n\nIf you can't access your blog even after this then we'll have to make changes to you NameServer settings for your domain.\n\n\n###Setting Up NameServer for domain\n\n**Step 1:**\n\nLogin to control panel of digitalocean and look for the tab in sidebar called DNS.\n\n* Hit the add domain button\n* Add your domain name\n* Select the droplet from the dropdown\n* Hit create domain\n\nAnd thats it try accessing your website again\n\n**Step 2:(if the above doesn't work)**\n\nThis will happen if you are using any custom CDN like CloudFlare\n\nIf so you'll have to change your \"**A Record**\" for that to point to the droplet server's IP. Try and get access to you DNS Zone file either from your domain provider eg:Godaddy or service like cloudflare. Once you have that look for \"A record that points to some ip\" it will look like this\n\n\t\tA yourdomain.com 123.456.789.10\n                \nChange the IP here to the droplet server's IP save the file wait for a couple minutes and do a hard refresh for the page.\n\nAnd this should be sufficient, me personally I haven't come across any other issue than this.\n\nHead on to yourdomain.com/ghost to create your a new user and start blogging.\n\n![Ghost blog admin login](https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/ghost/ghost-signup.png)\n\n\n\n\n###Using your custom theme:\n\nUnlike other platforms using a custom themes on Ghost is a bit tricky if you are not used to Git or Terminal.\n\nBest way is to use Git and access the theme from bitbucket or Github to get the latest copy.\n\n**Same drill to get into console**\n\nWe'll install Git in our droplet obviously to use git, hit this command\n\n\t\tapt-get update && apt-get install git-core -y \n\nthis will take only a minute or so to install.\n\nOnce this is done we'll go into the themes folder in Ghost using this\n\n\t\tcd /var/www/ghost/content/themes/\n        \nNow you are in themes folder find a theme hosted on Github or Bitbucket or you can even put your's over there and use that       by cloning it into our directory\n\n\t\tgit clone https://github.com/naveen052/ghost-portfolio/archive/master.zip\n        \nTry to avoid git clone over ssh because public key might reject that, So the above command clones the theme in the theme folder next step is to go back to ghost admin dashboard and select theme from the select theme dropdown in general getting page.\n\n**Updating your theme**\n\nIts really easy to update the theme, go into the theme folder\n\n\t\tcd /var/www/ghost/content/themes/\n        $ ls (to see what folders are in there)\n        casper your-theme (available themes)\n        $ cd your-theme (go into your theme folder)\n        $ git status (just in case)\n        $ git pull (pulls the latest changes/updates)\n        \n\nAnd that's it!\n\nHopefully theses steps helped you. Happy Blogging!",

Once you have that look for \"A record that points to some ip\" it will look like this</p>\n\n<pre><code>    A yourdomain.com 123.456.789.10\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Change the IP here to the droplet server's IP save the file wait for a couple minutes and do a hard refresh for the page.</p>\n\n<p>And this should be sufficient, me personally I haven't come across any other issue than this.</p>\n\n<p>Head on to yourdomain.com/ghost to create your a new user and start blogging.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/ghost/ghost-signup.png\" alt=\"Ghost blog admin login\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"usingyourcustomtheme\">Using your custom theme:</h3>\n\n<p>Unlike other platforms using a custom themes on Ghost is a bit tricky if you are not used to Git or Terminal.</p>\n\n<p>Best way is to use Git and access the theme from bitbucket or Github to get the latest copy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Same drill to get into console</strong></p>\n\n<p>We'll install Git in our droplet obviously to use git, hit this command</p>\n\n<pre><code>    apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install git-core -y \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>this will take only a minute or so to install.</p>\n\n<p>Once this is done we'll go into the themes folder in Ghost using this</p>\n\n<pre><code>    cd /var/www/ghost/content/themes/\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now you are in themes folder find a theme hosted on Github or Bitbucket or you can even put your's over there and use that       by cloning it into our directory</p>\n\n<pre><code>    git clone https://github.com/naveen052/ghost-portfolio/archive/master.zip\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Try to avoid git clone over ssh because public key might reject that, So the above command clones the theme in the theme folder next step is to go back to ghost admin dashboard and select theme from the select theme dropdown in general getting page.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Updating your theme</strong></p>\n\n<p>Its really easy to update the theme, go into the theme folder</p>\n\n<pre><code>    cd /var/www/ghost/content/themes/\n    $ ls (to see what folders are in there)\n    casper your-theme (available themes)\n    $ cd your-theme (go into your theme folder)\n    $ git status (just in case)\n    $ git pull (pulls the latest changes/updates)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And that's it!</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully theses steps helped you. Happy Blogging!</p>",

        "slug": "jabra-rox-wireless-earbuds-review-and-pairing-fix",
        "markdown": "Got the Jabra Rox Wireless headsets a couple days ago, being my first bluetooth earbuds and not finding much about it other than the paid reviews, I figured why not write about my own experience with these. After reading a few reviews and seeing a few unboxing videos finally decided to go for them, the choice was limited to Jabra, Plantronics and JBL. \n\nI wanted to get the Jaybird BlueBud X but sadly they are not available in India and shipping them off Amazon might have cost me another $50-$60 in shipping and handling. The JBL J46BT wireless earbud were another choice but read a few reviews saying it had battery issues and sound not up to the mark, I would have still gone for the JBL if I hadn't found the Jabra Rox. Another option was one from Plantronics but honestly I didn't really like designs of JBL and Plantronics, the Jabra rox stood out...I'll get to why in a minute.\n\n\nJabra Rox are my first bluetooth earbuds, so I didn't know what to expect in terms of sound, my initial search was based on the way earbuds were designed, and these dont disappoint in terms of that. The earbuds themselves are solid light weight aluminium, while the wires are built out of premium quality rubber and looks really premium. The length of the wires were perfect for me, it easily wrapped around my neck.\n\n\n### Getting the Right Fit:\n\nThe sound quality highly depends on the fit of these earbuds, if it fits you perfectly then they sound perfect, but if you have troubles in fit then sound might not be that great, **its all about getting the right fit**. Jabra give you 3 size options for ear-wings and 4 options for eargels(stock included) both made with premium quality material. Try and experiment with various sizes to get the fit right. The size that worked for me was :\n\nRight : \n\n* Medium EarWings\n* Double decker eargels\n\nLeft :\n\n* Small Earwings\n* Double decker eargels\n\n\n> A word of advice do not try to listen to them unless you think you have perfect fit, they sound really bad if you dont have them on properly.\n\nGetting the fit right is most important part. The EarWings help in supporting the earbuds while running or on the go, if the fit is good they wont fall off.\n\n\n### Sound Quality:\n\nI am not an expert in this department but having used a few high end earbuds and headphones, these do sound pretty good being \"wireless bluetooth earbuds\". I love bass and was a teeny bit disappointed with bass output from these, but they are not a deal breaker. Classical music, RnB, Pop, Country songs were great all round, perfect sound clearity and no problems whatsoever. \nOn a scale of 10 I would rate them 8.\n\n\n### Call Quality:\n\nTo be honest I just made one call having these on, the voice from the other side was perfectly clear and hopefully my voice was clear as well because the caller didn't point out that my voice is breaking or something, and I was in a public place during the call with lots of traffic and people, so hopefully the background noice cancellation works as well.\n\n\n### Battery and Power saving: \n\n\nBattery for me has lasted about 6.5 hours of continuous listening during my work hours and they do work as expected, but this might not be the case with everyone as there might be a lot of digital interference around, but somewhere in the median of 5-7 hours is what you can easily expect. \nThe best part of these earbuds is magnetic snap to put the earbuds to sleep, the back of both earbuds have magnets that once snapped, put the earbuds to sleep and it wakes up soon as you detach them. The magnets also help in hanging the earbuds around the neck (like a necklace) when not being used this is really helpful all the times. If you get tired of listening just snap on the magnets, put it to sleep and let it be hanging around the neck. \n\n\n### Pairing with devices: \n\nI paired it with and Android phone, the initial paring was easy as 1,2,3. I had some issues related to it as described below, but that was just me, may be my device was faulty or I am stupid.\n\n**I tried pairing with a few phones that had NFC and was working perfcetly fine with those devices. So atleast NFC is not broken in mine**\n\n\n### Problem in Pairing Jabra Rox:\n\n* I initially paired it with Huawei Honor 3C smartphone (worked prefectly)\n* Decided to connect it to other devices (that's when I ran into trouble)\n* iPad, Macbook Pro, Moto G couldn't connect also these devices couldn't even find the earbuds.\n* I read online that you have to disconnect from one device compeletely **(like doing: forget this device in bluetooth settings)** to connect it other device \n* So I did that on the Phone that it was working on, still, nothing worked and suddenly even the first phone couldn't find it.\n* So now I was stuck with a bluetooth device that was just flickering green led, and devices that are supposed to be having Bluetooth v4.0, I was disappointed.\n* Did a lot of research online, tried contacting Jabra support but no reply from the internet as well as the Jabra support.\n* By this time I figured that I might have to reset the Jabra Rox\n* I even tried going in to the linux shell (if it had one, don't know if it does) by connecting via USB (didn't work: the cable is just for charging)\n* So now I was all crazy and pressing buttons restarting it over and over again, I even factory restored my Android Device (nothing worked)\n\nBut then out of all the permutations and combinations of key presses and restarts, something stuck and I actually did it!\n\n#### So to reset your Jabra Rox all you have to do is :\n\n* Turn on your Jabra Rox\n* Check if the led is flickering in green\n* Once Rox are on, hold the multifunction center key and the volume up (+) key both at the same time\n* Keep Holding it until the led turn from green > magenta > red \n* Once the lights are out your Rox are now turned off, if you see these color changes that means you have reseted your Jabra Rox.\n* Turn on the Jabra Rox again now you should see the blue led light flickering meaning that its searching for bluetooth device, check any of your devices and connect it.\n\n> Its highly likey that this issue was exclusive to me, but atleast now you know how to reset the Jabra Rox\n\nSince this debacle I couldn't gather courage to disconnect from this phone and connect it with some other device. I will try it out on this weekend though.\n\n\n#### Overall Experience:\n\nIt took away a lot of time figuring out that reset thingy, other than that its totally worth it.\n\n* Sounds Good\n* Looks Cool\n* Is Waterproof\n* Is Shockproof\n* Converts in to a cool neckband\n* Battery is great\n* Magnet snap for power saving is really helpful\n* Price Rs.7000 Or $120\n\nI would rate them 8/10\n\n",
